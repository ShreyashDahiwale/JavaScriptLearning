# Node.js
1. **What is Node.js?**
- Node.js is the cross-platform JavaScript Runtime Environment which helps us to run the JavaScript outside of the Web Browser. 
(Cross-Platform: It is designed to operate on multiple systems).
- It is built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine.
- It enhances the JS capabilities to use for building server-side applications.
- V8 Engine: This engine compiles JavaScript code into machine code, allowing for efficient and fast execution.

2. **How Node is a runtime environment on server side? What is V8?**
- On the server side, Node JS' runtime environment also includes the V8 Engine and APIs for file system access and network communication, among other functionalities.

3. **What is the difference between Runtime environment and Framework?**
- A ***Runtime*** environment is merely a platform to execute commands. Popular are JRE (Java Runtime Environment), Node.js (for JavaScript), it process the code and produce results. 
- It don not enforce development patterns... they just run the code.
- ***Framework*** focuses more on best practices, i.e. the development patterns means the way you should write the code. 
- Frameworks are opinionated, designed to produce predictable outcomes. Example: Express.js
- Without Express.js, it is still possible to create web server from scratch upon Node.js. But that is time consuming and require to know all the nuances of how a web server works.

4. **What is the difference between Node.js & Express.js?**
- Both are used in web development. 
- Node.js is the runtime environment for JavaScript.
- Express.js is the web application framework built on top of Node.js. It simplifies and streamlines the process of building web applications and APIs.

5. **What are the differences between Client-Side(Browser) & Server-Side(Node.js)?**
- Web Browser executes client-side scripting. It is used when the browser have all the code. 
- These processes are carried out on the User's device. 
- Web Servers are used to execute server-side scripting. Web servers is where the website or web application is hosted. 
- These processes typically executed by the server before the website or web application is deliver to the user's device. 

- The main differences between the server-side and client-side processes is the amount of control and access to the resources that each has.
- Server side processes has access to the server's resources such as CPU, Databases, memory, storage, or other servers. 
- Client-side processes have only access to the User's device, such as CPU, storage, or memory.
